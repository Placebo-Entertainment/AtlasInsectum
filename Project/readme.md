## Setup
To get debugging in vscode:
- install the [godot extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=neikeq.godot-csharp-vscode).  
- create copy of `.vscode.example` 
- rename it to `.vscode`
- inside `launch.json` and `tasks.json` change the executable  
  so it points to the .exe you use to start godot
